# Custom-views-Android
I wanted a grid like layout but I could not pull it out with Android GridLayout. So I decided to make one using LinearLayout. The downside of this was I had to repeat the LinearLayout to the number of items I needed in my layout. I did not want to do that. I decided to make a custom LinearLayout that I could resuse the number of times I needed it. So I made the custom layout, I have called SimpleCard.

This is the Layout I was able to achieve.
